Currently broken/needs testing.

Project goals:
 - Construct any kind of desktop environment from a select pool of apps, binaries and data files. 
 - From a base container image, create any kind of desktop environment I want, streamed to any device I want.
 - Rather than creating an environment that can do everything at once, it creates very focused workspaces, omitting unecessary noise, it should be able to stream an individual app omitting the desktop altogether, or it can spawn multiple containers with the flexability of a thin/fat client, allowing the user to work on/stream abroad applications of their choosing to accounts abroad.
